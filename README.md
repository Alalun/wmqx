WMQX is a support http protocol MQ service based on RabbitMQ development, his predecessor was [wmq](https://github.com/snail007/wmq), thanks to his author, my friend [snail007](https://github.com/snail007). Of course, you can also understand that WMQX is an enhanced version of wmq.

# Why need WMQX?
RabbitMQ is lightweight and easy to deploy on premises and in the cloud. It supports multiple messaging protocols. RabbitMQ can be deployed in distributed and federated configurations to meet high-scale, high-availability requirements.
